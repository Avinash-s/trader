Creating a pull request for this branch is a common scenario when collaborating on projects using version control systems like Git. Below are the steps to create a pull request:

Clone the Repository:

Go to your repository on GitHub.
Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository URL.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Use the git clone command to clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL you copied.
Create a New Branch:

Change to the repository's directory on your local machine:
cd <repository_name>
Create a new branch for your changes. It's recommended to give the branch a descriptive name related to your changes:
git checkout develop

git checkout develop -b JIRA-TICKET-NO-TICKET-TITLE

Make Changes using visual studio:

Open the file using a visualstudio.
Make the necessary changes to the file, such as updating code project information, adding instructions, fixing typos, etc.
Commit Your Changes:

After making changes, save the files.
Add the changes to the staging area using the git add command:
git add filenames
Commit the changes with a meaningful commit message describing the changes:
git commit -m "JIRA-TICKET-ID-ticket-title"
Push Changes to Your Repository:

Once the changes are committed, push the changes to your repository on GitHub:
git push --set-upstream origin JIRA-TICKET-ID-ticket-title
Create a Pull Request:

Go to repository on GitHub.
You should see a message indicating that you recently pushed a new branch.
Click on the "Compare & pull request" button next to the branch name.
On the pull request page, review the changes you made.
Add a description for your pull request, explaining the purpose of your changes.
Click on the "Create pull request" button to submit the pull request.
Wait for Review and Merge:

Your pull request is now open for review by the project maintainers.
They will review your changes and provide feedback if necessary.
Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository, and your changes will become a part of the project.
That's it! You have successfully created a pull request for the README file and contributed to the project.
